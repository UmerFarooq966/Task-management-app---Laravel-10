# Task-management-app---Laravel-10
task management application where users can perform CRUD operations on tasks.

**CRUD Operations:**<br>
Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks.<br>
Each task should have a title, description, and status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed").<br><br>
**Web Hooks:**<br>
Implement a Web Hook system that triggers notifications when a task is updated.<br>
Notifications can be sent via email or any other preferred method.<br><br>
**Front-end:**<br>
Use HTML and Bootstrap 5 to create a simple and intuitive task management interface.<br>
Implement JavaScript and jQuery for dynamic interactions, such as updating task status without refreshing the
page.<br><br>
**ACL (Access Control List):**<br>
Implement ACL to control access to certain tasks based on user roles.<br>
Define roles such as "Admin," "Manager," and "User."<br>
Assign permissions to roles (e.g., Admin can perform all actions, Manager can edit tasks, User can only view
tasks).<br><br>
**Authentication**<br>
Implement authentication for API access (e.g., using Laravel Auth Ui / vue)<br><br>
**Feedback Feature**<br>
Include a feature that allows users to provide feedback on tasks.
