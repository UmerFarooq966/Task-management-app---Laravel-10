# Task-management-app---Laravel-10
task management application where users can perform CRUD operations on tasks.

**CRUD Operations:**
Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Each task should have a title, description, and status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed").
**Web Hooks:**
Implement a Web Hook system that triggers notifications when a task is updated.
Notifications can be sent via email or any other preferred method.
**Front-end:**
Use HTML and Bootstrap 5 to create a simple and intuitive task management interface.
Implement JavaScript and jQuery for dynamic interactions, such as updating task status without refreshing the
page.
**ACL (Access Control List):**
Implement ACL to control access to certain tasks based on user roles.
Define roles such as "Admin," "Manager," and "User."
Assign permissions to roles (e.g., Admin can perform all actions, Manager can edit tasks, User can only view
tasks).
**Authentication**
Implement authentication for API access (e.g., using Laravel Auth Ui / vue)
**Feedback Feature**
Include a feature that allows users to provide feedback on tasks.
